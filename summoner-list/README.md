# Getting Started

Hi there, thanks for visitng my project! This is Summoner Search, a search tool that uses the League of Legends Riot Games API. You are able to look up players by their in game name. This application currently only supports players in the NA region.

You can install dependencies using the `npm install` command. 
Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. 
The app will be served at <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser.

Note: to use locally, you must replace API_KEY in Profilesearch.js with your own API key. You can sign up for one [here](https://developer.riotgames.com). It is free and available for use once you sign up; however, the API key expires every 24 hours.

# Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```npm start```

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
